# How to set up a 1-1 channel

## Getting started

1. **Create a Google Doc** and name the file `[INITIALS_OF_FIRST_PERSON]-[INITIALS_OF_SECOND_PERSON] 1-1`.
   1. For example. if Bob Adrian Jones is meeting with Jen Tai Yin Lee, the title of the file would be `BAJ-JTL 1-1.`
   2. Use three letter initials when possible since there may be people with the same initials. 
   3. The manager, or the more senior person, should be listed last. If seniority is the same, the person with the last name that starts with a letter earliest in the alphabet should be listed first.
2. **Share the file** with the other person, using the **Share** option in the Google Doc.
3. Create a Direct Message channel in Mattermost and add the other person. 
3. **Add a link to the Google Doc** at the top of the Direct Message channel by editing the header of the channel. Choose **Edit Header** and paste the link. 
4. **Use the file for 1-1s** to post material in advance and to write notes of your discussions.
